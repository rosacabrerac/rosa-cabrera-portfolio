# Rediscovering my passion

Published on: 19-02-2026

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## 2009

In 2009 (I was 15 back then) I wanted so bad to learn how to code! The
first tutorial I followed and loved was this one [Cómo crear tu página
web](https://comocreartuweb.com/) (How to create your web page). I enjoyed
it so much! I don't remember how long it took to complete it, but it was
awesome. I deployed it using a free web service (something like Netlify
now) and it stood there for a couple years!

## 2021

Life did its things and I forgot about that time when I was happily creating a web page, but in 2021
(I was 27) I felt lost. Not knowing what to do or pursue, I fortunately
recalled that time in 2009. I enrolled in [Jóvenes a Programar](https://www.instagram.com/jap_uy) and in 2022 I started working as a QA.

## Now

So... Not web development yet, but it was a good time. Mid 2025 I decided
to finally go back to my now roots and start again! freeCodeCamp was and
still is my best friend. There I started my journey again, learnt
Responsive Web Design, refresh my knowledge in JavaScript and thanks to
their hackaton/cohort (started in February 2026), I started learning Astro! I've been also working on
learning from Miguel Ángel Durán (midudev) through his [free bootcamp](https://www.jscamp.dev/) , there I had my first introduction to React.
